Aatma-dev: Man, upon taking birth, performs worship of various deities according to the customs of his household, and observing traditions, he continues to do prayers and worship. He does not have a direct vision of any deity. Still, with faith and devotion, he expresses his inner feelings before that deity. On Mondays, he worships Mahadev, on Tuesdays, Hanuman, on Wednesdays, Saraswati, on Thursdays, Dattatreya, on Fridays, Lakshmi, on Saturdays, Shani, and on Sundays, Surya; thus, in life, he worships many deities. The purpose of this is that life should proceed happily and peacefully. The more he wishes for something, the more trust he places in the deity fulfilling that wish. Upon close inspection, it can be seen that due to your faith, your work is completed, but not fully—only about twenty-five percent. You may feel that, because of the next deity, your work has been accomplished. But in reality, it is not like that; you join your hands before the deity, close your eyes, and express your wishes with complete concentration, and that prayer is fulfilled by the spirit within you. In fact, your spirit is God, and it has been fulfilling every desire in life and will continue to do so. Truly, to make life happy and joyful, one should worship only one deity or guru; if it is Mahadev, then one should consider themselves as Mahadev and perform meditation and worship accordingly; some may worship Ram, some Krishna, some Mauli, and some Vithhal, dedicating themselves to one power according to their preference. Understanding it all as an extension of your own spirit, they receive immense benefits—trust, faith, and concentration increase, making life happier and simpler. Likewise, we also have many gurus in our lives, and we take their blessings through their vision. We worship all gods and visit various gurus, with the main reason being to make life enjoyable and peaceful. However, this search continues until you achieve a close vision of the God/God which is with you. That God is your Aatma-dev. This God, through the grace of the Sadguru, is seen within you as Divine Eyes. Once you have the vision of your own spirit, only then does the hustle of your life come to a halt. The mind becomes fulfilled, and it rests in contentment and joy. Then, true happiness in life is attained, and you become liberated in life.
