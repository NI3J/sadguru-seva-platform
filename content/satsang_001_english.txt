Dream Creation: In dreams we see a different view, person, occasion, idol of the goddess, the deity of the goddess, and meets the deceased, and tells that my desirable God came in today, the family of the family has come, etc.  I say that I went to Mumbai.   Let's know what the truth is.  The first thing in the dream we see a different picture, the goddess or a different picture, all the thoughts that come to the second country are all in your mind or in the mind. They often think that in the dream, and your soul shows all the occasions, the person, the God, etc. in the dream.   After waking up, you say that I saw this in dreams.  In the dream, what you see in the dream shows all your soul.  It costs your self -power.  Therefore, those who dream are not enthusiastic after they get up.  Those who have a deep sleep (no dreamless sleep) appear to be freshly twisting after getting up.  They have a lot of excitement.   So what is dreaming is all false.  It should not be misunderstood by understanding the truth.   Do not dream, do not sleep during the day, work from the body, the body gets a deep sleep after tired.  When sleeping at night, you should sleep by meditating on your desirable God or Sadgur.   30-40 minutes before bedtime should be separated/closed from TV, Mobile, Paper.  Wash hands and feet and sleep by meditation, memory of the name.  Sleep of happiness comes, nature remains nice. The coming days are excited and joyful. Selfishness Ki Jai Ho, he is your God, even when you sleep, he protects you and gives the same power the next day.
