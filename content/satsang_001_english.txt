Sadhguru Vani: Believing or relying on God: People say ordinary people, we are trusting God.  If God wants, we will be saved.  In this world, our Indians who live on the trust of God are our residents and are at the forefront of progress.   When Russia was on the verge of God, he was hell.  When they left the trust on God, they were fun.  If Russia had gained self -realization, it would have been more dry.   This (Russia) country is afraid of falling because they do not believe in self -esteem, they all rely on heavy science. India has relys on God because of its rely on God.  Sadhguru believes that there will be nothing to do with God's will, which will happen by your will.  Whatever you want, want to be self -confident and firmly, you must go.   Do not understand yourself, if you do not doubt your self -esteem, if you do not have any obligation to yourself, there is no power in the world that will obstruct your path, stuck in a bond or difficulty in fulfilling your mind.   The true Guru preaching is that it should be self -reliant.  Until you will not be self -sufficient, you will not be able to be full of happiness and life unless you will not develop your self -esteem.   The most excellent tool for liberation, happiness, power, health and knowledge is self -reliant, self -realized and self -reliant.  Self -esteem is the largest power.  We can get what we want.   Whatever we want to happen, we need strong faith in it.  A man himself slaves him, drinks himself and plays Jupva (the intention is to get money without hard work). Man becomes a slave of a fantasy and religious God. If a man does not follow the bad ways, he does not follow the bad thoughts, there is no power in the world that can stop his self -progress.  The soul has an infinite power.
