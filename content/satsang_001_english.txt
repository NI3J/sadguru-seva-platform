Today, once again, we have gathered in this Kathamandap (narrative pavilion) to contemplate Bhagwan (Lord) Paramatma (Supreme Soul) for the analysis of Shri Shivmahapuran, a seven-part compendium describing the virtues of Bhagwan Ashutosh Mahadev (Lord Shiva). This program is organized in memory of the respected Mataji (Mother) Gangabai Namdev Bachate, and today marks the beginning of the discussion for the second session on the second day of the program. Before that, I offer my respects to all of you from this platform. My friends, my kings, my mothers, sometimes we suddenly receive wealth, but if that wealth comes suddenly, its importance diminishes. Similarly, this entire plan was suddenly organized in our village within a month and a half, and this divine union occurred. Ask our workers in Latur about the importance of Satsang (holy gathering). People toiled for six months to organize Satsang, and the essence that emerges from that Satsang fills every pore with joy. If something is easily obtained in life, it loses its value, but if it is obtained after much effort, that thing or subject holds great value. Therefore, we will sit here for seven days to contemplate the virtues of Bhagwan Ashutosh Mahadev Shankar. Everyone, please join me in chanting the name of Bhagwan Paramatma once, and then we will proceed to the next story.
Present here, all of you mothers, embodiments of the compassionate Lord Ashutosh, who are devoted and eager for the Shivpuran Katha, know that water is precious to one who is thirsty. You are attached to your worldly life. Without worshipping the Lord, without contemplating the Lord, without seeing the Lord, a seeker is such that they do not even drink a sip of water. A seeker is such that they see the Lord everywhere. A seeker is such that they only see the form of the Lord in specific places, like in a temple. A soul, one with Shiva, does not let दुर्गम enter the mind. The soul is the same for all of you and me. Therefore, He is present in all creation, but we cannot understand Him, we cannot know Him. What will we gain from the Katha, from being in the presence of a Sadguru? We will gain wisdom from the Katha, and through that wisdom, you will be able to embrace the Lord. From any Katha, you gain wisdom. Does God come to meet you through the Katha? No, you become aware of truth and falsehood, right and wrong, morality and immorality, and according to that awareness, you travel on the right path, and you will realize the existence of truth on that path. Without Satsang, there is no wisdom. Without Satsang, you will not gain wisdom. Satsang does not mean that you set up a mandap and sit down to narrate a story. Satsang is when you are alone, even if you are alone, if you contemplate the truth in your mind, many people contemplate worldly things more when they are alone. I have seen many people who get more tension when they are alone – tension about their wives, tension about their children. I have a disciple. One day I went to his house unexpectedly. His wife said, "He doesn't talk to anyone, he seems to be in depression." I went and sat in his room. He was sitting seriously, as if in meditation. After a long time, I asked him what was wrong. He said, "Nothing, Baba, I have no value in the house, no one listens to me." See, if they don't listen, then leave them and come with me! What a joyful thing that would be! But he is worried that no one listens to him in the house, yet he wants to work for that house. Whose misfortune is this, tell me? Think about it, why are you doing it? For what are you doing it? Yesterday, our topic had reached the point of ego, the ego of appearance. My mothers, however beautiful you are, has no one more beautiful than you ever existed in this world? Many beautiful people have existed, and more beautiful people will exist. Has no one ever been wealthier than you? Many wealthy people have existed, and more will exist in the future. Has no one ever been more prestigious than you? Many have been, and more will be in the future. If there were people before you and there will be people after you, then why your ego? You can be proud of something that has never happened before and will never happen again, something that you have that no one else in the world has. Then it is different if you have ego. But when you have an egoistic attitude even when you have nothing, that is wrong. Yesterday, our topic was about Chanchula, who had lustful feelings in her mind towards her husband and others. See, if lust is all there is to life, if that is what life is all about, then think about the animals. Animals also wander around to fill their stomachs, work, and fill their stomachs. Animals also have offspring, don't they? But animals eat and keep walking. But if you consider that to be life, then my friends, think about what the difference will be between them and us. They also do the same thing – eating, eating, eating. Their joy is also the same as yours. The joy that you get from marital bliss is the same joy that an animal gets with its mate. The joy that you get from sleeping on a Dunlop mattress is the same joy that a donkey gets from rolling in the ashes. The joy is the same, the joy is not more or less. You may have more wealth, and because of that wealth, you can get facilities, but you cannot get happiness. What is the definition of happiness? What do you call happiness? Who thinks that more money means more happiness? Raise your hand. More money means more facilities, but not more happiness. And if more money meant more happiness, then so many wealthy people in this world would not be wandering in search of happiness. If you want to attain happiness, then you have to stand on Dharma. The fruit of Dharma is happiness. What is Dharma? See, if a husband tells his wife to commit adultery like him, and gives her permission, will that be Dharma? If a couple is completely immoral, if the life of a couple in this country becomes directionless, then what values will they be able to give to the coming generation, to the children? What can you expect from children whose parents have gone astray? That Chanchula left her husband. Now her husband commits adultery and dies, becoming a demon on Vindhya Mountain. But even now, the nature that she has developed does not leave her. With that nature, she lives at home with her children, but her adultery continues outside. And as her youth fades away, youth will fade away for everyone. No matter how much you decorate yourselves, my mothers, my kings, my friends, your inner self should be decorated. The more your inner self becomes cheerful, the more radiance will be created on your face. And no matter how much you forcibly decorate yourself, if you remain sad inside, then even the decorated face will look swollen. Be cheerful inside. "Prasanna Chitte Paramartha Darshanam" If you want to see the Supreme Soul, if you want to communicate with that Mahadev, if you want to embrace that Mahadev, then you have to do what Mahadev wants. What does Mahadev want from you and me? He wants your cheerfulness, He wants the cheerfulness of your heart, nothing else. He has created this entire universe. In the coming creation, you will understand, you will realize that the reason for this world is only and only Mahadev. "Hey Mere Mahadev, Mere Har Khushi Ka Karan Bhi Tum Hi Ho Aur Samasya Ka Samadhan Bhi Tum Hi Ho." If there is a reason for your every happiness, then it is only Mahadev, and if there is a solution to your every sorrow, then it is only Mahadev. My friends, after the death of Chanchula's husband, she became even more adulterous, but youth left her, and because youth left her, she became estranged from her children. And now she has become old. And in that old age, she became helpless, took a bag, and started wandering. Wandering, she went to the Kokarna region in Karnataka. There, she bathed in the holy waters and started walking with her bag. Beside her, in a temple, a group of Brahmins was narrating the story of Lord Ashutosh Mahadev. And by a coincidence of karma and dharma, that Chanchula reached the mandap. Just as Chanchula sat in the mandap, the words came out of the storyteller's mouth that he was going to describe the suffering of an adulterous woman after her death. After hearing that, Chanchula got scared. Chanchula realized that this was for her. She didn't know what to do. Finally, she went and bowed down at the feet of that Brahmin group, saying, "O Mahadev, O Devbappa, O Brahmin deities, see, in my youth, many sins have been committed by me, but now my body is not working, and after listening to the story from your mouth, I now want to repent. Tell me what to do? How will I be redeemed?" At that time, that Pandit said, "O Chanchula, if you want to atone, do you acknowledge your mistake? Until you acknowledge your mistakes, you will not atone. When you acknowledge your mistakes to yourself, then you atone. पश्चातापः पापकृतां पापानां निष्कृतिः परा। सर्वेषां वर्णितं सद्भिः सर्वपाप विशोधनम्।। If you want to atone, then no matter how big the sin, all your sins will be destroyed, don't worry. But one thing, you should not atone today and then commit the same mistake tomorrow. Atonement is when, once you accept it, you will never go on that path again. That is called atonement." She atoned with a pure heart and told the Brahmin deities that from today onwards, you are my parents, you are my gurus, as you guide me, so I will walk. The Brahmin deities, the virtuous ones, purified that Chanchula through the Shivkatha. One day, Yama's messengers came to take Chanchula, but at the same time, Shiva's messengers were present there, and Shiva's messengers took that horribly sinful Chanchula with them to Shivaloka. After reaching Shivaloka, what does Chanchula see? There, all the gods, Brahma, Vishnu, are in the service of Mahadev, the Vedas are praising Mahadev, Parvati is sitting beside him, all the deities around are trying to please Mahadev, and in the midst of those holy deities, this Chanchula has reached. Seeing Chanchula, Parvati took her close. See how compassionate my God is. No matter how many sins you commit, He gives you a chance to improve, He gives you a chance. It is a different matter that we do not improve. But one thing is certain, we are not as sinful as Binduka and Chanchula. If the pile of their sins can be reduced, then why not ours?
