True, beautiful and independent thought: Man is a mental being (Vichār Maya). He is exactly as his thoughts, mind and heart are. No power can free his thoughts, mind and heart, if he does not want to be free from himself. Happiness, liberation and independence are not in the hands of others but in your own hands. If you really want to be free, then you are free today. Man is a mental being, if his mind, thoughts, intellect and heart are impartial, independent and independent, then he is also free. There is no such power in the world that can suppress a truly independent and self-reliant man. A man becomes a slave only because of his thoughts. Who will tell the people of India that without doing good deeds, you should pray day and night before God? When will the God of Hindus and Muslims tell you to fight against each other for them? Who will tell America and Europeans that you should become slaves of money? No one. Man himself is in trouble and trouble because of his own thoughts. We can say to the British that they ruled our country by force, but who told you to do what you have been doing for hundreds of years, becoming slaves to idols and gods or bowing your heads before God? Which God, idol and gods told you to become our slaves, to consider us your masters? Why does God need our service and help? When will God tell you to leave all your work and keep ringing the bell? When will God tell you to keep dancing and beating drums in our name? When will God tell you to consider yourself as slaves, considering us your masters, owners and kings? When will God tell you that not even a blade of grass can move against his will and therefore you should sit idle and do nothing? Never. There is no such thing, all this has been written in the name of God and placed before the world. There is no fault of the living God. Everything is the fault of our own thoughts. Indians are very happy to be called Ramdas, Krishna as a servant and Hussain as a slave. They do not want to become masters. The feelings of independence are first created in the mind in the form of thoughts. Later those thoughts reach the physical body. Everything depends on thoughts. If you want to be independent, free and liberated, then change your thoughts. There is no problem in becoming independent and liberated through thoughts. There is no such power in the world that can hinder your intelligence and freedom. If you want to be completely free, then do not become a slave of God either. No one can be free from slavery and servanthood. Remove old thoughts and feelings of slavery from your head, then you are already free. This is the path to liberation. 🪷🌼🕉️🙏🏻
