Shri Shiva Mahapurana Katha
Sapta Samhita — Sacred Scripture in Seven Compilations

In Sacred Memory of Respected Mataji Gangabai Namdev Bachate

Day Two | Second Session


1. Opening & Welcome
Once again today, we gather in this sacred katha mandap (discourse hall) to contemplate the divine qualities of Bhagwan Ashutosh Mahadev — as described in the Shri Shiva Mahapurana, the sacred scripture comprising seven compilations — for the reflection and meditation upon the Supreme Soul.
This programme has been organised in loving memory of Respected Mataji Gangabai Namdev Bachate. Today marks the Second Day, and we are beginning the Second Session of this sacred event.
Before we begin, I offer my respectful salutations to all of you from this sacred platform.


2. The Importance of Satsang
My dear friends, my dear brothers, my dear mothers — sometimes we receive wealth unexpectedly, but when that wealth comes suddenly, without effort, we do not value it. Similarly, this entire programme was organised within just one and a half months in our town, and yet this divine gathering has come together beautifully.
If you truly want to understand the value of satsang, ask our dedicated workers from Latur — they laboured for six months just to organise one satsang. And the essence that emerges from such a satsang fills every pore of your being with divine joy.
If something is obtained easily in life, it has no real value. But when something is obtained after great effort and perseverance, it holds immense worth. That is why we are going to sit together for seven days, contemplating the divine qualities of Bhagwan Ashutosh Mahadev Shankar.
Let us all chant together with me, and then we shall proceed to the katha.

4. The Purpose of the Katha — Attaining Viveka (Discernment)
To all those present here — devotees filled with divine love, the mothers who carry within them the sacred longing for the Shiva Purana Katha — just as a person who is thirsty understands the true value of water, similarly those who feel a deep longing for the Lord understand the true worth of this katha.
Without singing the praises of the Lord, without meditating on the Lord, without seeking the vision of the Lord — no seeker finds true fulfilment. One seeker is so absorbed that he does not even drink a sip of water until he has had the Lord's darshan. Another seeker sees the Lord everywhere around him. Yet another sees the Lord's form only in specific sacred places — like a temple. But the truth is: the Atman — the soul — is the same in all of us. The same divine presence pervades all of creation.
What is gained through this katha? Viveka — discernment — is gained. And through that discernment, you become capable of recognising and receiving the Divine. When any katha takes place, does God come personally to meet you? No. But you gain the awareness of truth and untruth, of right and wrong, of righteousness and unrighteousness. And with that awareness, you walk the right path — and on that path, you will discover the existence of Truth.
"Binu Satsang Vivek Na Hoyi" — Without Satsang, there is no Viveka (discernment).
And Satsang does not merely mean sitting in a tent and listening to a katha. Even if you are alone — if you contemplate truth silently in your own mind — that too is satsang. I have seen many people who, when left alone, only worry. Worry about the wife, worry about the children, worry about money.
I have a disciple — one day I visited him unexpectedly. His wife said he had become quiet, not speaking to anyone, as if depressed. I went to his room and sat with him. He was sitting silently, like he was deep in meditation. After a long time I asked — 'What happened?' He said, 'Nothing, but I have lost my value in my own home. Nobody listens to me.' I said — 'Well, if nobody listens, why not leave and come with me?' He was somewhat amused. But think about it — if they don't listen, and yet you still want to keep working for that same household — whose misfortune is that?


5. Ego — A Dangerous Illusion
Yesterday, our discussion had arrived at the topic of ego — specifically the ego of beauty and appearance. My dear mothers, do you truly believe that no one more beautiful than you has ever been born in this world? Many more beautiful people have existed, and more will come. Has no one wealthier than you ever existed? Many wealthier people have lived, and more will come. Has no one more respected or honoured than you existed? Many have been, and more will be.
If those who came before you were greater, and those who come after will be greater — then what is the basis of your ego?
If truly nothing like yours has ever existed in the universe — Bhooto na Bhavishyati (neither in the past nor in the future) — and you still feel pride, then perhaps it is understandable. But when you have nothing extraordinary, and yet you cultivate a sense of superiority — that is a mistake. That is dangerous ego.


6. Pleasure, Worldly Life, and the True Definition of Happiness
Yesterday, we also touched upon the story of Chanchula — the attitude of sensory indulgence that had filled her mind toward her husband and others. Think about this — if life is only about pleasure and sensory enjoyment, if that is what you call 'sansara' (worldly life), then consider: animals also roam around to fill their bellies, they work and eat. Animals also have offspring, don't they?
But animals eat and move on. If you also call that same thing 'sansara', then tell me — what is the difference between them and us? They also eat, drink, and reproduce. The joy an animal experiences with its mate is comparable to what humans experience in sensory pleasure. The joy a person gets sleeping on a soft bed is comparable to the joy a donkey gets rolling in the dust. The quality of joy is not that different.
When your wealth increases, you gain access to more facilities and comforts — but not necessarily happiness. What is the definition of happiness? Many people believe that when money increases, happiness increases. Who thinks that? Raise your hand. But money only gives you facilities — not happiness. And if wealth truly brought happiness, then why are so many wealthy people still wandering in search of happiness?
If you want true happiness, you must establish Dharma (righteousness) in your life. Happiness is the fruit of Dharma. What is Dharma? Consider — if a husband tells his wife, 'I permit you to also engage in immoral conduct like me' — is that Dharma? If married life in this nation becomes directionless and unethical, what kind of values can we pass on to the next generation? What can you expect from children whose own parents have gone astray?


7. The Life Journey of Chanchula
7.1 The Path of Immorality
Chanchula had abandoned her husband. Her husband, who had also fallen into immoral ways, eventually died and became a wandering spirit (pishach) on the Vindhya Mountains. And yet the nature that had formed within Chanchula did not leave her. Carrying that same nature, she returned home to live with her children — but her immoral conduct continued outside.
7.2 The Fading of Youth
As time passed, her youth began to fade — as it does for everyone. No matter how much you adorn yourself outwardly, my dear mothers, my dear brothers, my dear friends — your inner self must be adorned. The more peaceful and joyful your inner self, the more radiance will shine upon your face. And no matter how much you dress up on the outside — if you are suffering within, even a decorated face looks swollen and pained.
"Prasanna Chitte Paramartha Darshanam" — In a peaceful and joyful heart, the Divine is revealed.
If you want to meet Mahadev, if you want to commune with Him, if you want to embrace Him — you must do what Mahadev desires. And what does Mahadev want from you? Your happiness. The joy of your heart. Nothing else.
7.3 Arrival at the Holy Site of Kokarna
As her youth completely faded, she became distant from her children, and old age arrived. She had enjoyed life during her youth — now old age had come. In that helplessness, she took her bag and set out. Wandering on her journey, she arrived at the sacred pilgrimage site of Kokarna in Karnataka. There she bathed in the holy waters of the tirtha (sacred pool) and began walking, carrying her bag.
7.4 Entering the Katha Mandap
Nearby, in a temple, a brahmin scholar was narrating the katha (sacred story) of Bhagwan Ashutosh Mahadev. And by the divine play of karma-dharma, Chanchula found herself at that very mandap. She sat down in the katha hall, and the words that emerged from the mouth of the storyteller described — what fate awaits an immoral woman after her death, what torments she must endure.
Hearing this, Chanchula was gripped with fear. She realised — this is meant for me. She did not know what to do. Finally, she went and bowed down at the feet of that brahmin scholar.


8. Repentance and Atonement (Prayashchitta)
8.1 Chanchula's Plea
'O Mahadev! O Divine Father! O Brahmin Devata (revered teacher) — in my youth, I committed countless sins. But now my body no longer cooperates, and today I heard this katha from your holy mouth. After hearing it, I am filled with remorse. I truly wish to atone. What should I do? How can I be redeemed?'
8.2 The Pandit's Teaching
At that moment, the Pandit (scholar) said — 'O Chanchula, if you truly wish to perform prayashchitta (atonement), you must first accept your mistakes as your own. Until you genuinely acknowledge your own wrongdoings, you will not perform true atonement. Only when a person accepts his or her mistakes does he or she seek redemption.'
Pashchataapah paapakrutaam paapaanaam nishkrutih paraa |
Sarveshaam varnitam sadbhih sarvapaapa vishodhanam ||
(True repentance is the highest redemption for sins — the sages have declared it the purifier of all sins.)
'If you truly wish to atone, no matter how great your sins, all of them will be destroyed — do not worry. But there is one condition: you atone today, and then commit the same wrong tomorrow — that must not happen. Prayashchitta means — once you have accepted the path of righteousness, you will never return to the wrong path again. That is true atonement.'
8.3 Chanchula's Redemption
She performed her prayashchitta. With a purified heart, she devoted the remaining days of her life in surrender to the brahmin teacher, saying — 'From today, you are my mother and father. You are my Guru. Guide me as you see fit, and I shall walk that path.'
The noble brahmin teacher purified that Chanchula through the medium of the Shiva Katha. One day, the messengers of Yama (the god of death) arrived to take Chanchula. But at that very moment, the divine messengers of Shankar also appeared — and Shankara's emissaries took that Chanchula — that deeply sinful Chanchula — with them to Shivaloka (the divine abode of Shiva).
8.4 The Vision of Shivaloka
Upon arriving in Shivaloka, what did Chanchula behold? All the great deities — Brahma, Vishnu — were engaged in the service of Mahadev. The Vedas were singing Mahadev's praises. Parvati was seated by His side. Deities on all sides were engaged in pleasing Mahadev. And in the midst of all those pure and divine beings, Chanchula arrived.
Seeing Chanchula, Parvati drew her close and embraced her. See how compassionate my Supreme Lord is! No matter how many sins you commit — He always gives you the opportunity to reform yourself. He always gives you a chance. Whether we avail ourselves of that chance is a separate matter.


9. Conclusion
"He Mere Mahadev — Mere har khushi ka kaaran bhi Tum hi ho, aur samasyaa ka samaadhan bhi Tum hi ho."
"O My Mahadev — You are the reason for every joy of mine, and You are the solution to every problem of mine."
If there is anyone who is the cause of every happiness in your life, it is only Mahadev. And if there is any solution to every sorrow in your life, it is only Mahadev.
But one thing is certain — we are surely not as sinful as Binduka and Chanchula. If even the mountain of their sins could be dissolved, why would ours not be? The doors of the Supreme are always open for everyone.
