Steps on the Spiritual Path: After the soul takes birth in the world, it has to pass through various circumstances, acquiring different experiences, and progresses according to its karmas, with the final step being reaching the path of meditation and devotion. Upon reaching there, it encounters the true guru. The true gurus come close to those souls that are 98% new. The remaining 2% of souls reach the true guru through some medium. The guru then sows the seed of awareness in their mind and grants them self-realization (knowledge of the soul). The divine eye opens through their grace, allowing them to witness the divine realm and experience the essence of the self (soul's form) through the subtle body. This is the vision and experience of God/Paramatma. After taking birth in the world, the soul first experiences various subjects. Then, according to its good deeds, it embarks on a pilgrimage/journey. After that, it leaves all else behind and, through mantra, yajna, and havan, gains experiences, gradually sensing the divine power. It worships its chosen deity at home. Upon acquiring these experiences, it comes to study and contemplate the Puranas and stories, ultimately arriving at the threshold of the Vedas and Upanishads, where it realizes that the soul/human itself is God. The Vedas explicitly state that you (human) are Brahman. The Vedas and Upanishads were written by humans through their own experiences of self-realization gained through yoga practices. They have made it clear that every living being (human) can attain divinity by following those principles and engaging in yoga practices. This is why the Supreme Being Himself comes in the form of a guru, searching for souls, guiding everyone, and ultimately demonstrating and proving that you (human) are God. Thus, the final step is meditation, through which the soul, after taking birth from its parents, meets the guru and becomes self-realized, attaining divinity. In summary, it is better to undertake a pilgrimage than to waste time in sensory desires; it is even better to perform mantras, yajnas, and worship of God at home; however, the best of all is the study of the sacred Vedas and Upanishads, culminating in the supreme practice of yoga and meditation. Through the path of meditation and devotion, a human becomes one with God and gains self-realization.
