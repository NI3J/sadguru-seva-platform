Words of the True Guru: After death, once the physical body is relinquished, the soul resides in the subtle body. The subtle body cannot be grasped by anyone. As subtle as it is, there is no element in the world that can exist without the soul and mind. Such a vast subtle essence cannot be held even by the agents of death or their father. Yamaraj, Yamdutas, heaven, and hell are all conceptual places; they exist in the minds of those who are religious. Thus, the agents of death and Yamaraj take away only those who believe in their existence. People from lower realms who believe in spirits are the ones troubled by them. Spirits do not approach those who do not believe in them. Belief in heaven, hell, Yamdutas, Yamaraj, spirits, ghosts, deities, and the God of religion offers no benefits but rather causes harm. Again and again, such thoughts circulate in their minds. The result is that after death, when a person dwells in the subtle body/mind body, they only see Yamaraj, Yamdutas, and hell, and they weep. Nowadays, some yogis are becoming heavy with dead meditation, preparing to extinguish their conscious form. Those who cannot release such thoughts can never find happiness or escape from binding, suffering, and the fires of hell. Therefore, if you wish to achieve complete happiness, to be freed from the torments of hell and reach the peak of progress, acquire knowledge of your true nature and acknowledge your inner strength; humanity has become unhappy due to forgetting all of this. ....🕉️🪷🙏🏻..
