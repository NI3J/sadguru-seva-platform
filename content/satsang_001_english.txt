All results are a product of our actions: Can anyone truly become learned without reading or studying, merely by chanting 'Ram Ram'? Can anyone become a wrestler without exercise? Some of it is the earnings from this life, and some is from past lives, but every bit belongs to us. People say that just as a son walks on his father's shoulders, similarly, one should walk with faith in God. This is incorrect. A son who walks on his father's shoulders will never become truly strong. Falling down two or three times is fine; there’s no loss in that, but he must make his own effort to stand up. Otherwise, even in a hundred years, your legs will not become strong. One must practice walking with the strength they have. Always strive to be self-reliant. The more you attempt to become self-reliant, the more strength you will gain. Those who do not work become weak. Persons who rely on a pension die early. Where water stagnates, it becomes stale. The river that flows the fastest is the clearest. In a blanket that is set aside, pests infest. A book left untouched gathers dust. Those who do not trust in themselves become cowards.

People say that if you trust yourself and relinquish faith in God, the Divine will be displeased. Such people speak out of ignorance. Now tell me, when a son begins to walk on his own feet, do the parents get angry? Never. When a son begins to walk on his own, the parents are immensely pleased. Witnessing a son work with his own intelligence and earn for himself brings great joy to his parents. Sons who live off their fathers’ trust and consume their earnings are cowardly, lazy, fearful, and foolish, and their parents are never happy with them. Therefore, be self-reliant. To become completely self-reliant, drop your reliance on God; do not seek sustenance from Him. Work with faith in yourself. Until you become self-reliant, your progress cannot happen.

You cannot become learned by studying on someone else’s behalf. You cannot become strong by exercising for someone else. You cannot satisfy your hunger by eating someone else’s meal. You cannot quench your thirst by drinking someone else’s water. Merely chanting God's name does not satiate your thirst. Hunger does not diminish by simply chanting God's name without eating. Your salvation will come through your own hands and actions. No one else can do anything for you. Hence, becoming self-reliant is the most important thing. Self-reliance strengthens and solidifies through self-dependence, self-confidence, self-knowledge, and self-worship. 🌞🪷💐🙏🏻🕉️
